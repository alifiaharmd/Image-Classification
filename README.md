# Image-Classification
Classifying the handwritten digit dataset with SVM and Multi-Class Weather dataset with CNN

# Repository info:
There are couple notebooks in this repository with different dataset and methodologies to classify the images.

1. The handwritten digit images

The experiment for classifying the handwritten digit dataset with SVM. There are also classification features used in this experiment, such as Histogram-Of-Oriented-Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP). The dataset is from the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database (MNIST) database. The digits are from number 0 to 9. The dataset contains two training data which consist of 60,000 training images and 60,000 corresponding labels and two training set which consist of 10,000 training images and 10,000 corresponding labels.

2. The weather images

The image classification task will use two baseline CNN architecture. The dataset consists of 1125 weather images with 4 classes which are Cloudy, Rain, Shine, and Sunrise. There are 300 images in cloudy class, 215 images in rain class, 253 images in shine class, and 347 images in sunrise class.
